# Corn Yield Prediction
## Partnered with the Ottawa L5 smart farm
Goal: To develop a data-driven decision making modelling which predict crop yield in the result of increasing productivity, performance and profitability.

### Model Overview

The predictive model consists of two models: Mechanistic or process-based model and statistical model. The predictive result from the Mechanistic model is feeded as an input parameter in the
statistical model. The Mechanistic model includes three sub-models: basic, model and nitrogen sub-model. An artificial neural network model is used as the statistical model.

### Water sub-model [1]

Performed modelling and simulation on all of three sub-models. The water sub-model comes from Amir et. al's study.
